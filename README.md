# DearDiary
DearDiary is a simple, private React app that helps users reflect on their mental health. Log how you feel and sleep each day using emojis and notes. All data stays on your deviceâ€”no login, no tracking. A safe space to build daily awareness, boost self-care, and support emotional well-being.
