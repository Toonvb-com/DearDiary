# DearDiary 📖❤️
DearDiary is a personal, privacy-first digital diary built with React, designed to support and improve mental well-being. The app allows users to reflect on their day by selecting from five simple emojis and adding notes about how they felt and how they slept. By encouraging regular emotional check-ins, DearDiary helps users build awareness of their mental health over time — without sharing data or requiring an internet connection.

All entries are stored securely on the user’s device using local storage, meaning nothing is ever uploaded or tracked. This makes DearDiary a safe space for honest self-reflection, ideal for users seeking a calming, judgment-free journaling experience.
